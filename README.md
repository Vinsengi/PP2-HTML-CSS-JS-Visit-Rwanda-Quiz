## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the pages of the site have a background image (Rwandan Flag to help user notice which country), I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. 

In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file, i have also used none valiable colors in css.

* I have used  --primary-blue: #1D70B8;
 * I have used --primary-green:green; for the progress bar
 * I have used --accent-yellow: #FAD201;
 * I have used --success-green: #20603D;
 * I have used --error-red: #D62828;
 * I have used --text-dark: #333333;
 * I have used --background-gray: #F4F4F4;
 * I have used --hover-blue: #144a7a;
* I have used  --timer-light-blue: #d9edf7;

* Background Colors: The primary blue is used as the body background, while light gray backgrounds are used for quiz cards and result sections to maintain readability.
* Button and Hover Effects: Buttons use the primary green on hover for interactivity.
* Feedback Colors: Green and red are used to indicate correct and incorrect answers, making it easy for users to see their performance.
* Timer Styling: A soft blue shade is used for the timer to make it easy to read against the quiz card background.
* Progress Bar: Gray and Green is used as an accent for the progress bar, visually representing quiz advancement.
This scheme keeps the quiz interface vibrant, visually consistent, and reflective of Rwanda's national colors. 

### Typography

* For the quiz text, i have used font-family: Arial, sans-serif.

### Imagery

As the website is called The Visit Rwanda Quiz, I used an image of the Rwandan flag as the background image to give the user the feeling that the quiz is really about this land they want to visit.

### Wireframes

No wireframe at this time as i did not have enough time to do this.

### Features

- **User Login**: Users can enter their names to personalize the experience.
- **Randomized Questions**: Each quiz session presents questions in a random order.
- **Countdown Timer**: Users have 15 seconds to answer each question.
- **Feedback on Answers (correct/incorrect answers)**: Immediate feedback is provided after each answer is selected.
- **Score tracking system and Score Summary**: At the end of the quiz, users receive a summary of their scores along with comparisons to correct answers.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Rwandan Flag Background**: The quiz is visually enhanced with the colors of the Rwandan flag.


#### The Home Page

as soon as you land to the quiz area, you start the quiz just after giving your name in. No navigations involved.

#### The Game Page

The quiz page displays the questions (11). every question has 15 seconds timer which stops as long as the user select his/her first choice answer.

#### The alert when time is over

If the user takes more than 15 seconds without selecting an answer, there will come an alert that show that 15 seconds are over and by clicking on "OK", moves the user to the next question.

#### The 500 Error Page

No error page was made. to be made in the next iteration.

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Give users the option to select the amount of questions in their quiz.
2. Add some historical information on some questions that could be displayed to the user if the user want it so.
3. Create a back end database to enable me to store scores which would then allow you to see how you scored in previous quizes.
4. Look further into the accessibility for people with colour blindness, perhaps by adding symbols such as a tick or cross next to the answer when they are checked.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
