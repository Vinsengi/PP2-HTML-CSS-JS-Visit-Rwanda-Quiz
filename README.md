## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the pages of the site have a background image (Rwandan Flag to help user notice which country), I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. 

In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file, i have also used none valiable colors in css.

* I have used  --primary-blue: #1D70B8;
 * I have used --primary-green:green; for the progress bar
 * I have used --accent-yellow: #FAD201;
 * I have used --success-green: #20603D;
 * I have used --error-red: #D62828;
 * I have used --text-dark: #333333;
 * I have used --background-gray: #F4F4F4;
 * I have used --hover-blue: #144a7a;
* I have used  --timer-light-blue: #d9edf7;

* Background Colors: The primary blue is used as the body background, while light gray backgrounds are used for quiz cards and result sections to maintain readability.
* Button and Hover Effects: Buttons use the primary green on hover for interactivity.
* Feedback Colors: Green and red are used to indicate correct and incorrect answers, making it easy for users to see their performance.
* Timer Styling: A soft blue shade is used for the timer to make it easy to read against the quiz card background.
* Progress Bar: Gray and Green is used as an accent for the progress bar, visually representing quiz advancement.
This scheme keeps the quiz interface vibrant, visually consistent, and reflective of Rwanda's national colors. 

### Typography

* For the quiz text, i have used font-family: Arial, sans-serif.

### Imagery

As the website is called The Visit Rwanda Quiz, I used an image of the Rwandan flag as the background image to give the user the feeling that the quiz is really about this land they want to visit.

#### The Home Page

as soon as you land to the quiz area, you start the quiz just after giving your name in. No navigations involved. You hide or show the quiz instructions if you prefer too. 
![The landing page](./assets/images/landing_page.png)
#### The Game Page

The quiz page displays the questions (x out of 11). every question has 15 seconds timer which doe NOT force the user to move to the next questions after 15 seconds (Allocated time for answering one question).
Before a choice answer is selected, the "Next" Button is hidden.
![Image of the quiz page](./assets/images/quizarea.png)


#### The Quiz area 
Once the user selects the answer, the "Next" button is shown. once clicked, the user's answer is then recorden as THE CHOICE, and then proceeds to the next question.

If the User would click on "Check your Answwer" Button, the the users would get an instant feedback of whether the selected answer is correct or not correct. Once that is done, the user can may only go to the next question.

#### The Scores Page

![Scores Page Image-2](./assets/images/score-page-image-2.png)


#### The alert when time is over

If the user takes more than 15 seconds without selecting an answer, there will come an alert that show that 15 seconds are over and by clicking on "OK", this should automatically move the user to the next question. However, that will be in the next iteration. Currently, the user is not moved to the next question automatically after 15 seconds, reason being that a user should select an answer first before he/she can move forward.

#### The 500 Error Page

No error page was made. to be made in the next iteration.

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Give users the option to select the amount of questions in their quiz.
2. Add some historical information on some questions that could be displayed to the user if the user want it so.
3. Create a back end database to enable me to store scores which would then allow you to see how you scored in previous quizes.
4. Look further into the accessibility for people with colour blindness, perhaps by adding symbols such as a tick or cross next to the answer when they are checked.
5. Force the user to move to the next question when the allocated 15 seconds are over

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
